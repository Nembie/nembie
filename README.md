**Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a curious individual who spends their free time as a developer (or perhaps it's the other way around? 🤔).**


Here's a bit about me:

🚀 I’m a full stack developer based in Rome, Italy.

💸 I have a keen interest in the world of finance and am always looking to expand my knowledge in this field.

🌐 I'm an active contributor to open source projects, doing my part to give back to the developer community.

🎧 I enjoy exploring new music, with a soft spot for lo-fi beats that set the mood.

📷 I'm a passionate amateur photographer, I love capturing special moments through the lens.
